DESCRIPTION: Alan Snyder presented 'Open Source Content Management Systems'
 . He introduced the concept of using a Content Management System (CMS) for
  managing a website\, and the pros and cons versus more traditional method
 s. There were also demos of several popular CMS's.\n\n\nMy presentation no
 tes are below (please bear in mind this is done from memory...)\n\n\n\n CM
 S Introduction \n\n\nI wanted to cover true CMS packages\, and not authori
 ng tools nor scripting methods\, both of which I introduced during the fir
 st part of my presentation. Therefore\, the definition of a 'CMS' that I u
 sed (and will use now to cover what I'll be describing later on) is a serv
 er-side software package which enables user(s) to easily create\, manage\,
  and maintain content (pages\, blogs\, forums\, documents\, images\, etc.)
  for a web site. This is a broad definition but I think it's a legitimate 
 description of what a CMS is and does. For my presentation\, I focused on 
 Open Source CMS packages. Be aware that there are a number of proprietary 
 and/or commercial CMS packages available for purchase. I won't discuss the
 se any further.\n\n\nLet's continue...\n\n\n\n Quick Overview \n\n\nWhat a
 re CMS's used for? Well\, here's the more popular uses for a CMS system...
 \nBlogs\nForums - think support pages and such\nWikis (FYI - this site run
 s on a CMS package known as 'MoinMoin' http://moinmoin.wikiwikiweb.de/)\nS
 tatic Pages (i.e. home pages\, corporate pages\, informational pages\, etc
 .)\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ's)\nImage Galleries\nFile storage and 
 organization\nStore Front\n... and much much more!\n\n\nIn fact\, CMS syst
 ems as a whole can do probably anything you're looking to do. It's most li
 kely a matter of finding the right CMS package for your needs and tailorin
 g it as desired. We'll talk about finding CMS packages and customizing the
 m later on. For now\, let's see if we can define what it is you need to lo
 ok for in a CMS system.\n\n\n\n Features \n\n\nBefore you choose a CMS sys
 tem\, you should at least have a basic set of requirements for what you ne
 ed your site to do. Will it be just a blog? Will it have one home page and
  some static pages\, like a corporate site? Will it need full-blown user s
 upport with wikis\, forums\, chat\, personal home pages\, workflow\, appro
 val processes\, and so on. You should make a checklist for yourself of all
  the features that you'd like to have on your site. Keep in mind that some
  CMS's don't allow you to add new features. Most do\, but not all. The mor
 e comprehensive packages allow you to either turn on/off features as you s
 ee fit\, and some let you download 'plug-ins' and additional components to
  give your site more flexibility. The system you choose plays a very criti
 cal part in how much you can expand your site (if you even want to at all)
 . If you're sure you just need a simple set of static pages\, then almost 
 anything will do. If you think you may be getting into managing multiple b
 logs\, or maybe have an e-commerce store front some day\, then you probabl
 y want to stick with the more feature-rich systems.\n\n\n\n Hardware and S
 oftware Requirements \n\n\nThe majority of open source CMS systems run on 
 the standard LAMP stack (Linux\, Apache\, MySQL (and even PostgreSQL)\, an
 d PHP/Perl/Python). It is a very rare bird to find one that doesn't run on
  this. The biggest factors that will drive the hardware and software you'l
 l need to host your site will be...\nFeature set\nNumber of users\nStorage
  and growth rate of your site\nResponsiveness (i.e. speed)\nComplexity (i.
 e. redundancy\, failover\, etc.)\n\n\nFor this article\, I'll only focus o
 n the first three. Responsiveness (tweaking your setup for speed) and over
 all complexity are really topics for another talk.  As a general rule of t
 humb\, the bigger and more complex the site\, the more hardware you're gon
 na need. :) \n\n\nIn terms of the langauges used to write the CMS itself (
 the 'P' in LAMP) - you should choose a CMS that fits your needs and your s
 kills. By 'skills' I mean ability to not only configure and install the CM
 S itself (which is usually a straight-forward case of reading the README f
 ile - RTFM!)\, but also the ability to customize and personalize it for yo
 ur needs. When it comes to the langauge that a CMS is written in\, it real
 ly only becomes important when you want to peek behind the scenes and mayb
 e change something that the package itself doesn't provide an interface or
  configuration file for doing. With this in mind\, if you don't want to to
 uch any code on the back end (which is not really as scary as it may sound
 )\, then look for a package that has an extensive configuration GUI. Other
 wise\, you can keep your options more open and if you're willing to roll u
 p your sleeves and dive in\, you can go with pretty much anything.\n\n\nAd
 vice: The most popular language used to write the Open Source CMS's is wit
 hout a doubt PHP. If you plan on doing any sort of advanced administration
  on your site\, it is well worth your time to learn PHP. In fact\, it's wo
 rth the time to learn at least the basics of whatever language was used to
  write the CMS you choose.\n\n\nChoosing a CMS\n\n\nThere are over one hun
 dred Open Source CMS packages available on the Internet. If you google for
  'Open Source' 'Content Management Systems' (the quotes are important beca
 use they tell google to find those exact phrases paired together)\, you'll
  find that the very first search result is this site http://www.la-grange.
 net/cms which does a pretty good job of listing about 90 CMS systems of al
 l kinds and gives a very brief description of what each does (some more br
 ief than others\, but overall a nice start). I recommend this site for new
 bies looking for a good breadth of what CMS systems are out there.\n\n\nAn
 other site with good CMS links and resources is http://www.opensourcecms.c
 om. This site does a tremendous job of organizing and categorizing CMS sys
 tems. Not to mention\, the site itself is very professional looking and is
  in fact run by a CMS system called 'Mambo' which can be found at http://w
 ww.mambocms.com. The site lists all of the major Open Source CMS packages 
 as well as screen shots of what each looks like (for most packages anyway)
 \, and what the package's home page itself says about that CMS. Additional
 ly\, users can post feed-back and rate each CMS on a scale from 1 to 10. T
 his site is the closest I've seen to being the comprehensive summary of CM
 S systems.\n\n\nA Time to Play\n\n\nRegardless of how you search for a CMS
  package\, you should now have some basic requirements in your mind that y
 ou'd like to have for your site\, and also some idea of the hardware and s
 oftware that you'll need to get your site up and running. After perousing 
 google\, and the sites listed in this section\, you should narrow your cho
 ices down to maybe 2-5 different packages that you think will suit your ne
 eds. From this set of candidate packages\, go to each of their web sites\,
  and join the mailing lists. Spend about a week or even two talking with u
 sers and others about what they like most and what they dislike most about
  each package. Invariably\, someone has tried all the packages that you've
  selected as candidates to use and they will be able to guide you more to 
 your final choice.\n\n\nAlso\, more often than not\, the home page for a p
 articular CMS package will be created and hosted by that CMS package itsel
 f. So\, if you want to see what a CMS looks like 'in action' you can usual
 ly just go to that package's web site. Some sites even let you play with y
 our personal preference settings like layouts\, color schemes\, fonts\, et
 c. Take advantage of this. CMS packages have come a very long way and prov
 ide you with a ton of options for configuration and layout schemes. Choosi
 ng one is very much a matter of personal taste mixed with functional requi
 rements. Choose the one that you feel will best suit your site.\n\n\nAdvic
 e: Don't be afraid to take chances and especially to make mistakes. It may
  take a few months to get your site to be just the way you want it. You ma
 y even go through 3 or 4 different packages and setups before you find the
  one that suits you best. I can personally attest to about 6 months of try
 ing out different packages and features and learning before I could really
  decide on what package suited me for my needs. Learning is a very importa
 nt part of the journey of finding the right system for your site. Have fun
  with it and play as much as you can. In the long run\, you'll be glad you
  did.\n\n\nWhat can $that_cms do?\n\n\nI've personally used a few of the m
 ore popular systems out there\, and I host and admin a few also. So\, I ca
 n speak with some semblance of authority on these packages. Here\, I'll ju
 st outline quickly what each of the packages I have experience with can do
  and for the ones I don't have experience with\, I'll just summarize them 
 as best possible. Consider this a cheat-sheet for your research.\n\n\nLege
 nd\nUPG = Upgradable\, meaning the package allows you to download new func
 tional features as 'modules' or 'components'.\nTH = Themable\, meaning you
  can choose different color schemes for personalization.\nSK = Skinnable\,
  meaning you can change the physical layout of the site by moving sections
  around\, changing the order of things\, etc.\nCMS System Name\nFeatures\n

DESCRIPTION:Thursday's talk will be about Linux Virtualization.\n\n\nVirtua
 lization is a framework that allows for the abstraction of real resources 
 (hardware resources such as CPU\, memory\, etc) and utilization of these a
 bstracted resources.  Using various virtualization techniques you can have
  one computer can appear to be many computers and have many computers act 
 as if they are all part of a single computer.\n\n\nTwo common Linux Virtua
 lization tools (User Mode Linux and VMware) will be demoed in detail and p
 ossible uses of the tools will be discussed. Other tools may be demoed als
 o if time allows.\n\n\nI'd also like to encourage audience members to shar
 e their experiences with virtualization tools.  Stories about inventive us
 es would be much appreciated (especially from you people with access to bi
 g iron *hint* *hint*).  It is time to think of computers as not being sing
 le entities with single task purposes running one operating system image b
 ut as both building blocks for massive computer systems and individually a

DESCRIPTION:Topic:  MythTV is a Personal Video Recorder (PVR) package avail
 able for Linux.\n\n\nQ&A: \n Q: If I have a capture card that encodes the 
 TV in hardware\, do I still have my recordings stored in Nuppel Video form
 at? \n A: No! I found this out from a buddy who has a Hauppauge PVR-250 (2
  of them\, in fact). The stored recordings are MPEG-2 files that are named
  with the .nuv \n extension simply for consistency. \n Q: Can I move recor
 ded files around? \n A: Well\, yes and no.  Here's the deal\, MythTV keeps
  an entry in the MySQL database for the 'recordings directory'  \n (eg. /M
 ythTV/recordings for me).  All recordings are expected to be in this direc
 tory.  The file names follow a specific scheme. \n For example\, let's say
  I recorded Jay Leno last night (channel 4\, July 14th\, 11:35PM to 12:35A
 M).  This channel and time  \n information is stored in one of my database
  tables. The corresponding NUV file on disk will be named something like 1
 004200507142335200507150035.nuv. \n If you wanted to relocate all of your 
 recordings to a new directory\, you could do so and simply change your Myt
 hTV configuration to point to the new directory. \n You could not\, for ex
 ample\, move only some recordings and then expect MythTV to find recording
 s in 2 locations. \n If storage space will present a problem\, you can alw
 ays create a logical volume (LVM - logical volume manager). This creates o
 ne virtual directory that \n spans (potentially) multiple drives\, where n
 ew drives can be added with no configuration changes. \n Any other questio
 ns I didn't get to answer\, or you thought of after the presentation? Feel
  free to e-mail me (jweir77 at gmail dot com) or Jeff (jeforde at gmail do
 t com). \n -Jim \n\n\nTopic: WRT54G - A Discussion on installing custom Li

DESCRIPTION:Have you ever wondered what software is inside your set top box
 ? your cell phone? the network appliance in your data center? Chances are 
 it is or will soon be Linux. Industry Analysts have predicted that more th
 an 30% of all Intelligent Device Applications will be developed on the Lin
 ux platform this year. In fact\, you may want to consider a custom Linux a
 pplication appliance if the traditional enterprise deployment of applicati
 ons is not keeping pace with your business demands.\n\n\nThis talk will pr
 esent some methods used when developing device software with Linux. Althou
 gh this discussion is based around device software\, these approaches will
  resonate with other Linux development projects.\n\n\nLinux projects are t
 ypically an integration of many different upstream source projects\, and m
 aintaining software that is based on these asynchronous projects can be co
 mplicated. There are certain techniques that can help reduce the cost of c
 onstant remerging as packages are upgraded.\n\n\nCross compilation is impo
 rtant to be able to do development on small targets\, and has requirements
  on compilers and system libraries. Cross debugging can help with both ker
 nel mode and userspace debugging\, using kgdb\, gdb or other tools.  While
  the lines between enterprise Linux application development and device app
 lication development are blurring\, there key differences in the developme
 nt paradigm. In an embedded platform issues such as board bring up\, creat

DESCRIPTION:This talk covered Linux storage software for making your system
  safer and more flexible.\n\n\nRAID helps protect from individual drive fa
 ilures by spreading data across multiple drives.\n\n\nLVM is a storage vir
 tualization subsystem that makes it easier to manage your system setup by 
 abstracting the physical storage hardware from the file system. This makes
  it much easier to resize partitions\, add and remove hard drives\, along 
 with some more advanced features not available with conventional physical 
 hardware.\n\n\nThe talk featured live demos using VMWare to demonstrate so
 me of the most common scenarios you may encounter.

DESCRIPTION:Not all that long ago\, numerically controlled milling machines
  cost more than your house. Nowadays you can get a small-scale milling mac
 hine\, some tooling\, and a cheap PC to run it\, all for the price of a fa
 irly spiffy PC. So what?\n\n\nWell\, for one thing\, real-time Linux makes
  it possible by generating motor-drive pulses with microsecond precision\,
  all in software. A cheap PC runs more-or-less stock Ubuntu atop a real-ti
 me kernel that makes the right things happen at the right time. You can\, 
 in fact\, play streaming audio while gnawing metal.\n\n\nI'll sketch how a
 ll the software hangs together\, show how I 'program parts'\, pass around 
 some Show-n-Tell parts\, then demo the actual mill... it's small enough to
  bring along\, but messy enough that we won't be doing any actual metal cu
 tting.\n\n\nUpdate:Let's make a mess! I'll run a plastic part and bring a 
 vacuum cleaner...\n\n\nMaybe CNC milling isn't for everybody\, but when yo
 u need a small part made of Pure Unobtainium\, this is how you get it done

  a communication bus that Linux applications can use to send events and ex
 port functions. Examples of events:\nNetwork Interface goes up\nPidgin rec
 eives a message\nScreensaver activates\n\n\nExamples of functions:\nSet pi
 dgin status\nSet rhythbox tracks\n\n\nThe best thing is you can do all of 
 this with very little programming experience\, given bindings to DBUS from
  easy to learn languages like Ruby. The talk will examine some of how DBUS
  works\, give a very brief Ruby crash course\, and show some example uses 
 of DBUS with Ruby example code.

DESCRIPTION:Sean Dague will be talking about his work on the OpenSim platfo
 rm\, an open source implementation of the Linden SecondLife protocol. With
  OpenSim you can easily build and host your own 3D virtual world. You can 
 also use it as a 3D toolkit for easily building specific 3D applications.
 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe talk will go over the emerging space littered by buzzwor
 ds such as: Virtual Worlds\, 3D Internet\, Web 3.0\, and give you and idea
  of some of the technology here. It will specifically dive into bringing u
 p your own OpenSim instance\, why you might want to\, and what you can do 
 with it once you have it running.\n\n\nYou connect to OpenSim with the Lin
 den SecondLife client. Attendees that have laptops\, working 3D accelerati
 on\, and the Linden client installed will be given instructions to play ar
 ound with a test instance running at the meeting.\n\n\n \n\n\n

DESCRIPTION:This month's talk will cover the concept of multi-factor authen
 tication\, as well as how to implement it at a low cost and free (as in li
 bre) software compatible way with the Yubikey.\n\n\nMulti-factor authentic
 ation is an old security concept which is gaining interest and adoption in
  recent years as the need for strong security and authentication grows thr
 oughout the computing world. By leveraging multi-factor authentication one
  can vastly improve the security of a system with a minimal impact to user
 s.\n\n\nUnfortunately traditional multi-factor authentication systems such
  as RSA tokens and SecureID cards are highly proprietary and extremely exp
 ensive. This has limited the use of this approach to robust user authentic
 ation to large corporations and governments.\n\n\nThe Yubikey is starting 
 to change that however. Yubikeys are low cost devices with a completely op
 en specification and open source client and back-end solutions. This allow
 s just about anybody to offer a powerful enhancement to their system's sec
 urity.

  powers and runs it all.\n\n\nSean O'Connor will be providing a quick over
 view of what cloud computing is/means/can so as well as and introduction t
 o Amazon's Linux based cloud computing offering\, EC2. Concepts will be ex
 plained for all to understand and an entire cluster of virtual computers w

DESCRIPTION:Arduino is an open-source electronics prototyping platform base
 d on flexible\, easy-to-use hardware and software.\n\n\nWhile you need not
  be a Real Engineer to build a project around an Arduino\, being a Real Pr
 ogrammer can sometime pose serious problems. Ed will explain why that's so
 \, starting with Arduino's historical background and the crucial differenc
 es between a microcontroller and a PC.\n\n\nThe Arduino universe includes 
 a wide variety of add-on boards that provide functions ranging from pushbu
 ttons to LCD panels to Ethernet interfaces. You may not need much solder t
 o produce a useful (or at least amusing) project of your very own.\n\n\nEd
  will bring along some Show-n-Tell projects that appeared in his   Circuit
  Cellar column\, so you can see Arduino boards in their native   habitat.
 \n\nThis meeting will be streamed live on ustream on the MHVLUG channel fo
 r those members of our community that can't attend the meetings directly.

DESCRIPTION:Crack is a C-like programming language that is being developed 
 by the presenter.  It aims to provide the ease of development of a scripti
 ng language with the performance of a compiled language. The 'crack' progr
 am is a 'script executor' that compiles source to machine code on the fly 
 (eventually caching the code to intermediate formats as appropriate).\n\n
 \nLLVM is a compiler toolkit that Crack uses for code generation.  It allo
 ws you to generate code for a Single Static Assignment based virtual machi
 ne.  LLVM virtual code can then be optimized\, jitted or written to variou
 s other output formats.\n\n\nThis talk will cover the details of the Crack
  language and the use of LLVM\, with some excursions into the world of com
 piler design and the differences between compiled and interpreted language
 s.\n\n\nRelevant Links:\ncode.google.com/p/crack-language/\nllvm.org/\nLig

DESCRIPTION:Browser extensions offer a way for linux users to build and dis
 tribute useful applications to a wide (cross platform) audience using open
  source tools. Two browsers in particular lend themselves well to extensio
 n development -- Mozilla's Firefox and Google's Chromium.\n\n\nBecause of 
 Mozilla's XPCOM system (Cross Platform Component Object Modeling -- simila
 r to Microsoft's COM system)\, Firefox essentially gives you access to the
  full capabilities of the host OS. Firefox itself it based on XPCOM and ex
 poses the entire Mozilla platform to extension developers. This is a power
 ful platform for building user facing applications\, even those that are n
 ot 'webby'.\n\n\nOn the other hand\, the extension API for Chromium is muc
 h less powerful\, but much easier to grok. It walls off developers from th
 e OS\, so extensions almost have to be networked and 'webby'. Nevertheless
 \, Google has made it so easy to build extensions for Chromium that it's h
 ard to ignore.\n\n\nWe'll go over the structure of the Mozilla Platform an
 d XPCOM enough to learn how it works and get our bearings. Although we wil
 l not be demonstrating the creation of an XPCOM component\, we'll review h
 ow it is done in C++\, JavaScript\, and even Python. Then we'll go over th
 e JavaScript API to XPCOM\, and briefly mention the binding for Python as 
 well.  With a grasp on XPCOM we'll skip ahead a little bit and explore XUL
 \, Mozilla's XML user interface markup language.\n\n\nWith XPCOM and XUL u
 nder our belts we'll stitch together a GUI build tool with JavaScript.  If
  all goes well we'll move into the much simpler JavaScript interface for C
 hromium. There are a few basic concepts to understand first\, like the wal
 led sandboxes\, but after that it's a simple matter of finding our way aro
 und the JavaScript API. Given some time\, we'll build the same GUI build t
 ool on the Chromium platform as well.\nLightning Talks\n\n\nIn lieu of lig
 htning talks this month\, Sean's going to talk a bit about the existing MH
 VLUG Officers proposal on the table\, and drive a bit of discussion around
  that subject.  This will start at around 6:00 and run till 6:30ish when t

DESCRIPTION:2 years ago I volunteered to help the Poughkeepsie Farm Project
  update their existing web presense and turn it into something more dynami
 c.  There were lots of possibilities of how to do it\, but at the end of t

 nch MHVLUG and Mid Hudson Astronomical Association websites.\n\n\nCMSs are
  interesting beasts\, especially Drupal\, as they live in a space between 
 a wiki with very little structure\, and a web framework where the skies th
 e limit. Out of the box Drupal does almost nothing\, but has thousands of 
 optional modules that add 1 feature each in a very Unix like way.\n\n\nThi
 s talk is going to cover both the technology of getting your first Drupal 
 site off the ground: things to watch for\, basic modules that you can't li
 ve without\, and gotchas that you are likely to hit along the way. It will
  also cover the softer side\, and share the experience I had working with 
 the Poughkeepsie Farm Project on their web transformation.\n\n\nSean Dague
  is the president and founder of MHVLUG. By day he's a software engineer i

DESCRIPTION:Since the beginning of time[1] we've used a basic 32bit address
 ing scheme to get around (known as IP Version 4). The standard four digits
 \, A.B.C.D\, are ubiquitous in the technology world\, and are the way that
  computers know how how to find each other.\n\n\nBut all good things must 
 come to an end. Much like the 32bit clock\, which runs out in 2037\, the 3
 2bit internet is starting to find it's limits. As mobile devices\, and ris
 ing economies consume the last of the remaing IPv4 addresses\, things are 
 about to get interesting.\n\n\nThe technology and standards community have
  been planning for this for a long time\, with a new protocol\, IP Version
  6. With available IPs dwindling fast\, IPv6 will be here before you know 
 it. Are you ready for the changes? Find out what IPv6 is and what the chan
 ges mean to you.\n\n\n[1] we reserve the right to contain 'back in my day'

DESCRIPTION:July's meeting is going to be in two parts. First\, we'll be do
 ing a showing of the Arduino Documentary\, which describes the evolution o
 f the popular hobbyist platform. With a running time of 28 minutes\, it's 
 a really compelling video.\n\n\nAfter that we're going to have Arduino sho
 w and tell\, with fame and fortune (well\, at least the fame part\, detail
 s coming shortly). We encourage all MHVLUG members to build and bring some
  Arduino based creation and show it to the group. Contest eligibility:\nMa
 in logic for whatever you are creating must be in a *duino platform (Ardui
 no or various clones)\nYou must be willing to open source under a standard
  open source license (BSD\, MIT\, GPL\, etc) and share the code and wiring
  diagrams of your creation. We'll be posting all of these on the MHVLUG we
 bsite as giveback to the community. We'll help with creating wiring diagra
 ms for anyone that's interested.\n\n\nIf you've never worked with Arduino 
 before\, consider this an excellent opportunity to get started with open h
 ardware hacking\, and we'd suggest you start with this very excellent kit 
 from Adafruit Industries that will take you through a number of Arduino ex
 ercises. A great place for beginners to start.\n\n\nIf you do have some ex
 perience but have been looking for something to do\, you might want to tak
 e advantage of this opportunity and work on submitting a project to the In
 structables/Adafruit Make It Tweet Challenge.\n\n\nCreations don't have to
  be spectacular\, this is about getting your feet wet\, and getting inspir
 ed by the creations of others. Hope to see you at the meeting\, and hope y
 ou bring out something cool to share with everyone!

DESCRIPTION:The Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray\, 'povray' to its 
 fans) is a multiplatform\, ray tracing program. Because it was developed b
 efore the GPL by an international team of individuals\, some of whom are n
 o longer available\, povray is currently 'copyrighted freeware'\, although
  the development team plans to release a future version under GPL. Povray 
 has been used for creating stunning three dimensional graphics by showing 
 off different light sources\, photon mapping\, photo blur and other photor
 ealistic capabilities. Greg will give a brief history of the program and t
 hen give an advanced tutorial by explaining\, line by line\, the code used
  in one of his more advanced projects. This animation\, The Relativity Tra
 in\, is a humorous demonstration about how the speed of light is constant 
 from all points of reference. While GUI modelers are available for povray\
 , this project is all code ... editing text with no GUI. Video and audio r
 ecording of the lecture is of course welcome\, but the files for the whole
  project will not be released electronically.\n\n\nGreg M. Johnson is a fa
 ilure analysis engineer at IBM's 300 mm semiconductor fab. He has been usi
 ng povray since 1996 and is the author of some scene files that ship with 
 the program.  As a hobbyist\, he has participated in several animation com
 petitions and was the winner (and sole entrant) to the January 2009 TC-RTC
  competition.  This entry\, The Relativity Train\, made use of some of the
  advanced features of a povray fork called MegaPov.\nLightning Talks\nEthe

DESCRIPTION:Open Source development is no longer the new kid on the block\,
  we've had 30 years of GNU\, 20 of Linux\, and over a decade of SourceForg
 e. When a lot of people dove in a decade ago scratching your own itch was 
 about starting something from scratch\, weaving from whole cloth. Now this
  is more about joining existing projects or dusting off efforts whose main
 tainer has moved on.\n\n\nContributing to open source projects is a grand 
 adventure. As some one that's been doing open source development for over 
 a decade\, on a wide range of projects\, Sean's got stories galore. These 
 involve starting projects from scratch\, joining and becoming an active co
 re member of existing projects\, and becoming the accidental maintainer of
  abandoned projects. These stories bring lessons about communities\, commu
 nicating\, and meeting new people: sometimes successfully\, and sometimes 
 failing horribly on all accounts.\n\n\nThe talk will cover personal lesson
 s\, specific examples\, and will at times be directly embarressing. But in
  the end it should bring a much more real sense of what it means to dive i
 nto an open source community\, what might work\, what surely won't\, and w
 hy open source development skills are a sure fire way to stay relevant and
  employable in the 21st century.\n\n\nSean Dague is the president and foun
 der of MHVLUG. By day he's a software engineer in IBM's Linux Technology C
 enter\, currently working on Samba development. By night he's an open sour
 ce hacker who is especially interested in web and mobile technologies. He'
 s presented in the past on numerous topics.\nLightning Talks\nMHVLUG Study

DESCRIPTION:For the latest up-to-date details\, see the Squidwrench site pa
 ge for ADD II\n\n\nRound one of Android Develepment Day was a huge success
 \, so we're doing it again. Once again\, bring your computer\, cable\, and
  Android device and let's help each other hack some Android apps. Almost e
 verybody left with Hello\, Android running (and some got quite a lot furth
 er) so start thinking about what you'd like to do next. You can dive right
  into that project you've always wanted to do or just move on to the next 
 levels of tutorial. If you need ideas or have ideas to share\, post them h
 ere.\n\n\nNOTE: This time\, we're assuming that people already have the An
 droid SDK installed and have successfully written and run the equivalent o
 f the 'Hello\, Android' application. If you haven't made it this far these
  links should help you out:\nAndroid SDK installation instructions\nHello\
 , World tutorial\nThe New Boston Android tutorials\n\n\nAs usual\, your se
 arch engine of choice will most likely provide you with many\, many more o
 ptions. If you get stuck ask for help here\, contact someone directly\, or
  just show up at a weekly meeting. Somebody should be able to help you get
  on track.\nWhat is Squidwrench?\n\n\nSquidwrench's mission is to promote 
 the interaction of creative and technical people in the Mid-Hudson Valley.
  Squidwrench is a home-grown community of creative people. Our modes of cr
 eation encompass painting\, composing and performing music\, building high
 -tech toys\, building low-tech toys\, and probably a lot of other stuff\, 
 too. There is no limit to the problems people can solve\, given the resour
 ces\, the inclination\, the assistance\, and the inspiration.\n\n\nAt Squi
 dwrench\, we hope to make all of those things available to our members\, a
 s well as to our local and global communities. People often find themselve
 s constrained by a lack of space\, tools\, and manpower. It is also far mo
 re likely that people will come up with ideas and attempt to execute those
  ideas when they are surrounded by people who can encourage them and give 
 them direction.\n\n\nLocation: \n\n\n        \n    OLB Room 205\, Vassar C

DESCRIPTION:Chef is a configuration management tool that you should probabl
 y be using if you have to manage more than a handful of servers. Chef help
 s system administrators automate much of their day-to-day work so they can
  then focus on more important and challenging tasks. In this month's talk 
 Sean O'Connor will be giving an introduction to Chef which will include so
 me background on what Chef is\, how Chef works\, how one goes about automa
 ting tasks with chef\, and (internet willing) a demo of Chef in action.\n
 \n\nSean O'Connor is currently a Partner at Saaspire\, a small startup in 
 NYC working on making it easier to work with behavioral data. Given that S
 aaspire is still a very small shop\, Sean does a bit of everything but his
  primary focus is development and systems administration. Sean was a membe
 r of and previous speaker at the LUG until he moved to NYC in 2009 and he 
 is very excited to be making a return to the Hudson Valley.\nLightning Tal

 n of the HTML specification since 1997\, a specification created before th
 e world saw Facebook\, YouTube\, Flickr\, Wikipedia\, or even Google.\n\n
 \nPerhaps it is a given that HTML5 is sorely needed. It promises to solve 
 practical and immediate problems with web standards (video\, animation\, m
 obile\, semantics\, and much more) that despite demand have gone unresolve
 d. Many of these problems\, however\, were already known to previous effor
 ts to standardize the web\, yet apparently failed where HTML5 has succeede
 d. Why? And what makes us think HTML5 won't suffer the same fate? This tal

DESCRIPTION:Amazon has made a big splash over the past 6 years with their e
 ver growing cloud services. Starting with virtual machines as a service an
 d cheap object storage\, to their “human as a service” via mechanical turk
 \, what you can now accomplish with an API call from your laptop is pretty
  amazing. It’s created a shift in the industry in how we think about compu
 ting resources.OpenStack is an Open Source Infrastructure as a Service lay
 er\, conceptually similar to some of the Amazon Web Services. Originally c
 reated by Rackspace and NASA to address their internal computing needs\, i
 t’s now grown into vibrant Open Source community that involves developers 
 from Red Hat\, Canonical\, IBM\, HP\, Intel and many many more. It powers 
 public clouds at Rackspace and HP\, it’s powering infrastructure at Wikipe
 dia\, CERN\, and Ebay.Come out for a great night. You’ll learn about Cloud
  Computing in general\, OpenStack in particular\, and why and how you migh
 t want to get involved.\n\n\nSean Dague is the president and founder of MH
 VLUG. By day he's a software engineer in IBM's Linux Technology Center. By
  night he's an open source hacker who is especially interested in web and 
 mobile technologies. He's presented in the past on numerous topics.\nLight

DESCRIPTION:Web technologies such as the ubiquitous web browser have evolve
 d quite a bit over 22 years of existence. The first prototype browser was 
 developed on a $6\,500 NeXT 'Cube' computer with a coax cable network conn
 ection that weighed over 20 pounds. Today for $300 or less you can walk ou
 t of a store with a computer that fits in your pocket\, is a supercomputer
  in comparison\, stays continuously connected to the Internet using a mass
 ive radio tower infrastructure and just happens to also be able to make te
 lephone calls. The web is in the process of reorienting itself to embracin
 g these early prototypes for cyborg implants.\n\n\nThis talk will be a whi
 rlwind tour of both the history and the future of the web. Topics discusse
 d will include the various types of mobile devices\, modern browser design
 \, and the implications that these new ways of interacting with websites w
 ill have for both experienced and budding web developers. The dead horse o
 f native apps vs web sites will be beaten yet again. We will examine how a
  new generation of Internet users are coming online where the keyboard and
  mouse is not the primary means of interacting with a computer and what ex
 pectations they will have. Web development techniques\, useful tools\, and
  design considerations will also be quickly introduced for those wanting t
 o dig in.\n\n\nBruce Locke is a Network Engineer and Linux System Administ
 rator by trade.  He's a regular at MHVLUG meetings and in the past has giv

DESCRIPTION:In the last 5 months the OpenStack project has landed 7000 patc
 hes from nearly 700 different contributors. Over 550 developers have contr
 ibuted to the tens of thousands of code reviews needed to land these patch
 es. All in a source base that's 1M lines of python code. After 3 years as 
 a project\, OpenStack is approaching the level of activity of the Linux Ke
 rnel. How can a project grow that fast\, onboard that many developers\, an
 d yet still have coherent releases that ship on time? By a fusion of the b
 est lessons learned from Open Source development\, from Agile Software dev
 elopment\, and a few new tricks of our own. All rolled together I call thi
 s Software Engineering 2.0.\n\n\nThis talk is going to give some backgroun
 d on OpenStack\, the challenges of a rapidly growing project\, and how we'
 ve addressed those in both tooling and process. You'll learn about code re
 view\; preemptive continuous integration\; and how testing clouds\, on clo
 uds\, with clouds\, is fun\, and not nearly as confusing as you'd imagine.
  Everything we've created for OpenStack is open source in it's own right\,
  so you can directly apply some of these techniques to your own projects. 
 This also gives a more modern view of where Software Engineering is headed

DESCRIPTION:Web components are a set of APIs that extend the native web pla
 tform to provide support for custom elements\, HTML imports\, encapsulatio
 n via Shadow DOM\, and templates. While web components are definitely the 
 future of the web\, support for them across modern browsers (IE\, Chrome\,
  Firefox\, Safari\, Opera\, ..) is uneven\, with Chrome being at the foref
 ront of adoption. Polymer is a 'polyfill' library from Google that fills i
 n the gaps on other browsers\, allowing developers to adopt and explore we
 b components usage in their applications today. In this day-long 'Dev Fest
 ' you will learn all about Web Components\, Polymer and Paper Elements (wi
 th Google Material Design). And you will work on step-by-step code labs th
 at will give you practical experience in developing both custom elements a
 nd full-scale web applications using this new platform. Space is limited s

 rams can cost around 1700$. Blender offers an alternative. Blender is comp
 letely free\, open source\, and constantly being updated. Blender\, often 
 overlooked because of its price or lack there of\, has many capabilities n
 ot the least of which is the two internal rendering engines\, an internal 
 game engine\, and a Python interpreter for scripting.This presentation wil

DESCRIPTION:Every one of us is at heart a 'maker'. We have ideas we want to
  bring to life\, and we want the satisfaction of seeing others use and enj
 oy the result. While our goals may be different (e.g.\, health\, finance\,
  community engagement\, expertise sharing\, career or entertainment)\, we 
 often find that mobile and web platforms provide the tools and exposure ne
 eded to take these concepts to the next level. And learning to design and 
 prototype mobile web apps can become an invaluable skill in your maker too
 l-belt.\n\n \n\nHowever\, building a web app today can involve dealing wit
 h a teetering stack of technologies (front-end\, back-end\, database\, clo
 ud) and making them work seamlessly together to create a rich user experie
 nce and a reliable\, scalable deployment. This can be a challenge for the 
 beginner interested in creating a rapid prototype today\, but also with a 
 view to making it into a battle-tested product later. Meteor can help.\n\n
  \n\nMeteor is a platform for developing real-time mobile and web applicat
 ions in a fraction of the time\, with built-in tools to support testing an
 d deployment\, and a highly-engaged community that provides extensive pack
 ages and support to facilitate rapid prototyping. In November 2014\, Meteo
 r hit version 1.0\, making it officially production-ready.\n\n \n\nIn this
  talk\, we'll do a quick refresher on Meteor principles\, then walk throug
 h a simple application that showcases the various concepts and utilities t
 hat make Meteor unique. The talk is geared at a beginner audience\, but as
 sumes some knowledge of JavaScript and HTML/CSS.\n\n \nCurrently looking f
 or volunteers. Sign up if you'd like to give one.

DESCRIPTION:Open source contributions are the lifeblood of the Rails commun
 ity. Without them\, the framework and community would disappear. Every day
  maintainers and contributors put their time and energy into building gems
 \, reporting bugs\, and improving Rails source code. Even so\, there are m
 any developers who are afraid to make contributions to open source project
 s and many maintainers who feel burnt out from the lack of gratitude and h
 elp. My talk explores the reasons contributing to and maintaining open sou
 rce projects can be overwhelming and daunting and how we can fix this thro
 ugh communication\, empathy\, and knowledge sharing. Using Rails as a focu
 s I'll explore some basic guidelines for contributing as well as helpful t
 ools and knowledge for traversing unfamiliar code. Together we can make op
 en source more open and welcoming for everyone\; maintainers\, contributor
 s and future developers alike.\n\n\nEileen M. Uchitelle is a programmer on
  Basecamp’s Performance\, Security\, and Infrastructure team. Eileen is an
  ardent contributor to open source\, focusing most of her energy on improv
 ing Rails. When taking a break from the excitement of refactoring source c
 ode\, Eileen enjoys craft beer and hiking in the Hudson Valley with her hu
 sband and their beautiful doge\, @AryaDog.\nLightning Talks\nCurrently loo
 king for volunteers. Sign up if you'd like to give one.
